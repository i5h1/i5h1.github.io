Hi.

I am **Heiswayi Nrird**, or just call me "WAYI" for short. Currently working as _Software Engineer_ at [Keysight Technologies](https://www.keysight.com/main/home.jspx?lc=eng&cc=MY), Penang, Malaysia. In my spare time, I love to experiment, code and build some geeky stuffs. Sometimes I love to [click with my camera](https://heiswayi.github.io/my-photography/) and explore around. Some of my works can be found on following sites; [GitHub](http://heiswayi.github.io/my-repos/), [Gist](http://heiswayi.github.io/my-gists/), [CodePen](http://codepen.io/heiswayi/) and [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/user/heiswayi/). For professional details, check out [my online resume](https://heiswayi.github.io/resume/) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://my.linkedin.com/in/nrird), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/heiswayi.nrird) or [Instagram](https://instagram.com/heiswayi.nrird/). If you have any inquiry, you may contact me via email; [hnrird@gmail.com](mailto:hnrird@gmail.com).

I also run [nrirdÂ·xyz](http://nrird.xyz), a personal project called creative studio that focuses on UX design, frontend app development and data visualization.
